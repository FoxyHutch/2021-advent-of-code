# 2021 Advent Of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the AoC 2021 in typescript.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed in your environment.

## Setup

With NPM:
`npm install`

With PNPM:
`pnpm install`

## See it in Action

Run it locally.
All results will be displayed in the console.
Each day of the calendar has its own package.json script.
Lets say you want to run the program for day two you would enter `npm run day2`.

## Tests

I used Jest as my Testinglib for this project.
To run all test simply type `npm run test` in the console.
